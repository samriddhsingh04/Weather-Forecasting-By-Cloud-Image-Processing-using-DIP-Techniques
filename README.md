# Weather-Forecasting-By-Cloud-Image-Processing-using-DIP-Techniques
To predict the weather at a particular area at any particular time with the help of the image of sky . We are using digital image processing techniques which process the images of the sky like Normalization, Cloud Masking algorithm and k-Means algorithm.
